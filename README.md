Dashboard **Summary**

These HR Analytics dashboards analyze employee attrition and performance from both an organizational overview and a detailed driver-level perspective. The dashboards track key workforce KPIs such as total employees, attrition count, attrition rate, and average income, while also examining how attrition varies by job role, education, performance rating, job satisfaction, work-life balance, job involvement, and commute distance. Interactive filters enable deeper exploration of specific employee segments, helping HR teams identify high-risk roles, understand the underlying causes of attrition, and support data-driven decisions aimed at improving employee retention and engagement.
